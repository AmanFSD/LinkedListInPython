A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference
(or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. The first node is called the head of the linked list, and the last node 
is called the tail. The tail node has a reference to None, indicating the end of the sequence.

In Python, we can implement a linked list using classes. Each node in the linked list is an object of the node class, 
which has two instance variables - val and next. val stores the value of the node, and next is a reference to the next 
node in the sequence.

The linked list class has a single instance variable - head, which is a reference to the first node in the linked list.

Advantages of using linked lists in Python:

Dynamic Size - Linked lists are useful when the size of the data set is not known in advance or when the size changes 
frequently. In Python, lists are dynamic by default, but linked lists provide even more flexibility in terms of resizing.

Easy to Insert and Delete - Inserting and deleting elements in a linked list is faster than in a list, especially for 
large data sets, because it involves only changing the pointers of the affected nodes. In contrast, inserting or deleting 
an element from a list can be a costly operation, as it requires shifting all the elements after the insertion 
or deletion point.

Efficient Memory Allocation - Linked lists are more memory-efficient than lists for certain use cases, because they 
allocate memory for nodes only when required. In a list, memory is allocated for all the elements at once, even if they 
are not all used.

Ease of Implementation - Linked lists are easy to implement and maintain in Python because Python provides built-in support 
for object-oriented programming (OOP) and dynamic memory allocation. It is easy to define a ListNode class and use it to 
build a linked list.

Versatility - Linked lists are a versatile data structure that can be used for a variety of purposes. They can be used to 
implement stacks, queues, and other data structures. They can also be used for various algorithms such as sorting, searching, 
and graph traversal.

Overall, linked lists are a useful data structure in Python because they provide flexibility, efficiency, ease of implementation,
and versatility.
